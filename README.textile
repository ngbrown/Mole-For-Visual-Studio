h2. Introduction

From the CodeProject article:

bq. Mole was authored by "Karl Shifflett":http://karlshifflett.wordpress.com/, "Josh Smith":http://joshsmithonwpf.wordpress.com/ and "Andrew Smith":http://agsmith.wordpress.com/ who make up "Team Mole":http://joshsmithonwpf.wordpress.com/mole/. The core development process took the team several weeks. Most of the additional enhancements were implemented by Andrew and Karl, with a lot of testing and feedback provided by Josh.

h2. Updates for Visual Studio 2010

The solution files were each loaded in in Visual Studio 2010, the solutions, projects, and generated files were allowed to update.  The target framework was then changed to .NET 4.0.  Any references still targeting 2.0 were updated to the 4.0 version.  Especially note that the path to @Microsoft.VisualStudio.DebuggerVisualizers@ changed to @C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE\ReferenceAssemblies\v2.0\Microsoft.VisualStudio.DebuggerVisualizers.dll@
